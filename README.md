# To apply config:
1. [Download](https://github.com/MrGrappleMan/tf2-cfg/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract.
   You have to put the "tf" folder alongside the "tf" folder pre-existing on your machine, which will merge the folders and replace some content.
2. Use these launch options in Steam:
```
-nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1 -precachefontchars -noipx -softparticlesdefaultoff -high -full
```
Remove the first two if you use Steam Remote play.
3. Use this [HUD](https://toonhud.com/user/mrgrapplemann/theme/M54UMDUK/)
