### Please backup any config files if you have any

![Updated on](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/MrGrappleMan/tf2-cfg?style=for-the-badge)

# To apply config:
1. [Download this](https://github.com/MrGrappleMan/tf2-cfg/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it. You have to put the "tf" folder alongside the "tf" folder pre-existing on your machine, which will merge the folders.
2. Use these launch options in Steam:
```
-novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1 -nostartupsound -console -precachefontchars -noipx -softparticlesdefaultoff -high -full
```

Optionally, you may use my HUD [FocusUI](https://toonhud.com/user/mrgrapplemann/theme/M54UMDUK/)
