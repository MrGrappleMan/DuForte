# To apply config:
1. [Download the repo](https://github.com/MrGrappleMan/tf2-cfg/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Extract it. You have to put the tf folder alongside the tf folder pre-existing on your machine, which will merge the folders.
2. Use launch options:
```
-novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1 -nostartupsound -console -precachefontchars -noipx -softparticlesdefaultoff -high -full
```
Optional, my HUD [FocusUI](https://toonhud.com/user/mrgrapplemann/theme/M54UMDUK/)
