### Please backup any configurations, huds, maps or sound files if you have any, or move them away prior to using this
This configuration is made in mind with average end computers, but not too low.

# To apply config:
1. [Download](https://github.com/MrGrappleMan/DuForte/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract.
   You have to put the "tf" folder alongside the "tf" folder pre-existing on your machine, which will merge the folders and may replace some content.
2. Use these launch options in Steam:
```
-nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1 -precachefontchars -noipx -softparticlesdefaultoff -high -full
```
Remove the first 2 flags if you use Steam Remote play or any sort of controller.
3. Use this [HUD](https://toonhud.com/user/mrgrapplemann/theme/M54UMDUK/)

It uses a mix of [mastercomfig](https://comfig.app/app/) 9.100.0 settings and custom aliases for enhancing performance.
