### Please backup any config files you have saved

# To apply config:
1. Set up mastercomfig prior to it.
2. [Download the repo](). Extract it. You have to put the tf folder alongside the tf folder pre-existing on your machine, which will merge the folders.
3. Use launch options:
```
-novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1 -nostartupsound -console -precachefontchars -noipx -softparticlesdefaultoff -high -full
```
